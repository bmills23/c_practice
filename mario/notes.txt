Integer overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type. 
In programming languages like C, integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. 
It can result in wraparound, where the value wraps around to the minimum value, or undefined behavior, where the behavior is not defined by the language specification. 
To prevent integer overflow, it's important to use appropriate data types, perform range checks, and handle errors gracefully.
